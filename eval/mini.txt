This document is used for testing the Agentic Assistant system.

AI systems often use multiple agents to solve complex tasks.
In this project, LangGraph is used to orchestrate planner, research, writer, and verifier agents.

The system processes uploaded documents, retrieves relevant information,
and generates grounded answers with proper citations.

This file serves as a simple example for evaluation and testing purposes.
